# Agents API is being deprecated

To be completed once it is released. We need to SWAP both RAG and MCP to use the responses API instead of agent. 
Currently MCP works in rhoai/odh-llama-stack-core-rhel9:v3.0 image but RAG does not (as far as i'm aware)
Waiting for new release.

TO DO:

RAG WITH RESPONSES API

RAG + MCP WITH RESPONSES API
